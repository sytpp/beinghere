### First 3 months 
Reception Center: You are required by law to stay at a reception center even if you have family living in Germany, and you must stay in the administrative district where the center is located.  Meals are provided and you are not allowed to cook for yourself.  In many cases, asylum seekers move to an asylum center after 3 months, but some reception centers double as asylum centers, so you stay put. 
 
### After 3 months
Asylum Center: Your reception center will provide you [with information](http://www.refugees-welcome.net/).
 
### Finding your own place
You must find an apartment through the media (newspaper, internet), the local housing center in your town, or a real estate agent.  Be aware that some housing services and most real estate agents charge fees.
 
### Signing a lease
You must sign a lease to rent a flat in Germany, which protects you and the landlord.  You must specify all agreements between you and the Landlord in this document including the rent amount and the date every month it is due.  You often have to sign a “handover record” to note any damage and the condition of the apartment.  It is legal for the landlord to ask you for a security deposit, and to return this deposit after you have left the apartment in good condition.
