The states (Länder) have the principal role on the German education system, meanwhile the federal government plays a minor role. 

The optional Kindergarten (nursery school) is provided for all children between two and six years of age

Grundschule starts from the age of six to ten.

German secondary education includes five types of school. The Gymnasium, the Realschule, the Hauptschule, the Gesamtschule and the Förderschulen/Sonderschulen. 

State schools do not charge tuition fees. The majority of pupils attend state schools in their neighbourhood.
