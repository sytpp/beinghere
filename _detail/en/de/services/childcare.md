The childcare benefits starts when the children are 1 year old.

The German government gives children the right to have access to educational institutions (nursery school, pre-school) or programs led by private individuals or organizations (in-home daycare providers).

Parents can leave the care of their children to others during the day or night, even on weekends.

The German government is funding the education of children regardless of how it is made the family nucleus.
