Warning: Be aware that organized crime and smugglers continue to use the same social media tools as everyone else.  Be vigilant against disinformation and offers that seem too good to be true.   Also make sure if you sign a mobile phone or internet contract you understand you are committed to the provider for the duration and cannot change plans.  Finally, when wiring money home, read the fine print to avoid heavy hidden fees.
